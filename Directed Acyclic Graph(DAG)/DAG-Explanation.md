# What is Directed Acyclic Graph?
-In mathematics, particularly graph theory, and computer science, a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** is a **directed graph with no directed cycles**. That is, it consists of vertices and edges (also called arcs), with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that following those directions will never form a closed loop. A directed graph is a DAG if and only if it can be topologically ordered (a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering),
