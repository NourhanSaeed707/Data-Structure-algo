# Heap Data Structure
- Heap data structure is a **complete binary tree** that satisfies the heap property, where any given node is
. **Complete binary tree** is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.
- **A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences:**

- All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
- The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.

- **Heap data structure** is a **complete binary tree** that satisfies the heap property, where any given node is:
- always greater than its child node/s and the key of the root node is the largest among all other nodes. This property is also called **max heap property**.
- always smaller than the child node/s and the key of the root node is the smallest among all other nodes. This property is also called **min heap property**.
