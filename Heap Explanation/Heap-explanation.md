# Heap Data Structure
- Heap data structure is a **complete binary tree** that satisfies the heap property, where any given node is
. **Complete binary tree** is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.
## A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences

- All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
- The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.
